# UI Testing with Selenium

## Brief

We were given the base URL of http://demoqa.com/registration/ to test using Selenium. It is a dummy form on a webpage used for people to learn automated testing. The task was to  write methods and use them in the tests that were written in the document we started with.

### To clone

*You will need ruby (v 2.5.1) for these tests to work*

1. Copy the SSH key from the main file page.
2. Go to terminal and navigate to where the file is to be placed, then run this command:

  ```
  git clone [copied SSH key]
  ```

### To run the tests

1. Change directory into the new file system.
2. Run the command:

  ```
  rspec
  ```

3. This will run all the tests. They will be green if they pass and red if they fail.
